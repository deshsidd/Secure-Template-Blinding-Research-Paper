# Secure-Template-Blinding-Research-Paper
Fingerprints as biometric authenticators are rapidly increasing in popularity, with fingerprint scanners available on many modern smartphones and laptops. Because these authenticators are non-revocable, special care must be taken to prevent leakage of the representative feature information of a user's fingerprint. While secure multiparty computation protocols have been designed to maintain fingerprint privacy during authentication, they do not protect the data stored on the authentication server. In this work, we develop a technique for blinding the stored biometric template such that the authentication server never observes biometric information in the clear, and cannot accidentally leak this information in the event of a breach. We show how our blinding technique can be combined with the privacy-preserving GSHADE protocol to privately compare biometric feature vectors using a variety of distance metrics with negligible overhead in computation time. We then construct a complete privacy-preserving remote fingerprint authentication system based on the Euclidean Distance metric, and show that a user can authenticate using privacy-preserving techniques in as little as 1.5 seconds. This work provides a template for designing low-cost blinding techniques for biometric authentication systems, and shows a practical use-case for secure multiparty computation protocols in remote authentication systems.
